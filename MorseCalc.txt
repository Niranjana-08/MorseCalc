                                            Morse Code Calculator

The Morse Code Calculator is a simple program written in C that allows users to encode text into Morse code and decode Morse code back into text. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their text or Morse code and choose the desired operation (encoding or decoding).


Features:

1. Encoding to Morse Code: Users can input text, including alphanumeric characters and special symbols, and the program will convert it into Morse code.

2. Decoding Morse Code: Users can input Morse code sequences, separating characters with spaces, and the program will decode it back into text.

3. Case Insensitivity: The program handles input characters case-insensitively, ensuring accurate encoding and decoding.

4. Error Handling: The program includes error handling mechanisms to detect and notify users of invalid input characters or Morse code sequences.


How to Use:

1. Compile the Program: Compile the program using a C compiler such as GCC. Use the following command:
    gcc morse_code_calculator.c -o morse_code_calculator
2. Run the Program: Execute the compiled program:
    ./morse_code_calculator
3. Select Operation: Choose the desired operation:

    Enter '1' to encode text to Morse code.
    Enter '2' to decode Morse code to text.
    Enter '3' to exit the program.
    Input: Follow the on-screen prompts to input text or Morse code, and press Enter.

    Output: The program will display the encoded or decoded result accordingly.
